" TikTok's location-based recommendation algorithm works by first identifying the user's location, then analyzing the user's search
history to determine what type of content they are likely to be interested in. The algorithm then uses machine learning to compare the
user's interests with content that is popular in their local area and recommends content that fits the user's interests. 
By recommending content that is popular in the user's local area, the algorithm encourages them to explore new content and connect with 
people who share similar interests. "
